# 🧪 Enabling Remote Testing through a Dedicated Dev Environment on Docker Swarm

### 🧩 Problem
Our QA engineers could only test applications locally, which caused major challenges when the team started working remotely.  
- Testing was limited to local machines.  
- No unified environment existed for QA to verify builds before production.  
- Manual setup and inconsistent versions often led to “it works on my machine” issues.

This lack of a centralized dev environment slowed down feedback cycles and made pre-release validation unreliable.

### ⚙️ Environment & Tools
- **On-premise server** used to host the new dev environment  
- **Docker Swarm** for orchestrating multiple microservices  
- **GitLab CI/CD** for automating builds, testing, and deployments  
- **Nginx** for routing service traffic  
- **Node.js** microservices stack

### 🛠️ Solution
To solve this, I architected and deployed a **dedicated Dev Environment** hosted on-premises with full CI/CD automation.

**Steps implemented:**
1. **Set up Docker Swarm Cluster** on internal servers to mimic production topology.  
2. **Containerized all services** (Node.js, databases, and APIs) with environment-based configurations.  
3. **Configured GitLab CI/CD pipelines** to automatically build, push images, and deploy on the Swarm cluster when developers merged code into the `develop` branch.  
4. Added **staging domain routing via Nginx**, allowing QA engineers to access builds securely from home.  
5. Implemented **automated cleanup jobs** to keep environments lightweight and resource-efficient.

### 📈 Impact
✅ **Enabled remote QA testing** — Engineers could test and verify builds from anywhere without local setup.  
✅ **Reduced manual deployment efforts by 90%** through CI/CD automation.  
✅ **Improved release confidence** — consistent and reproducible environments reduced environment-related bugs.  
✅ **Accelerated feedback loops**, cutting pre-release validation time from hours to minutes.
